<p>Resin art has a lot of similarities to my acrylic paintings  but with so much more! It is more vibrant and has more depth than what can be  achieved with acrylics. I can add textures to these paintings by incorporating  add-ins like crystals and glitters. I also do works of encapsulation with  resin, giving my art a 3-D effect. Resin has more fluidity that paints but  lacks the array of colors than paints. However, I can mix acrylic paints and  mica powders to achieve the desired color I am wanting. Resin is tedious to  work with. There is a lot of mixing involved and it can be hazardous. Plus, there  are other factors like work time and clean up. Once resin begins to set you are  unable to make any changes. Though this is a harder medium to work with it helps  with me mental by giving my mind something to dedicate my complete focus on and  keeps my intrusive thoughts at bay.<a href="assets/green.jpg"><img src="assets/green.jpg" width="200" height="287" alt="Resin painting with green and gold."></a> <a href="assets/silver.jpg"><img src="assets/silver.jpg" width="200" height="287" alt="Resin painting with silver and black"/></a> <a href="assets/purple.jpg"><img src="assets/purple.jpg" width="200" height="287" alt="Resin painting amethyst and gold."/></a></p>
