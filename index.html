<p>Paintings, knitting, scribbles and doodles, art comes in  many different forms. Art in any form or fashion has been shown to improve your  mental health in many ways, from reducing anxiety in children with asthma to stimulating  mental function in older adults with dementia. This is called Art therapy which  is a type of psychotherapy that helps patients interpret, express and  understand their emotions and thoughts. This website is dedicated to showing  how art therapy has helped me with my mental health struggles and hopefully  inspire others to try art therapy as well. </p>
